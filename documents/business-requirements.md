### Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description                        | User Story                                                                                                          | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Product Listing Display            | As a user, I want to see a list of all available products so I can browse and discover items to purchase.          | The system should display product cards showing product image, name, and price in a responsive grid layout with proper loading states.                                           |
| FR002          | Product Search Functionality       | As a user, I want to search for products by name so I can quickly find specific items I'm looking for.            | The system should provide a search bar that filters products by title on form submission, displaying relevant results or "no results found" message.                            |
| FR003          | Category-based Product Filtering   | As a user, I want to filter products by categories so I can browse items in specific categories of interest.       | The system should display available categories as multi-select filters that can be combined with search, updating the product list in real-time.                                |
| FR004          | Product Listing Pagination         | As a user, I want to control how many products are displayed per page so I can optimize my browsing experience.    | The system should provide pagination controls with configurable page sizes (50, 100, 200 items) and navigation between pages.                                                   |
| FR005          | Product Details Viewing            | As a user, I want to view detailed information about a product so I can make an informed purchasing decision.      | The system should display a dedicated product details page showing product image, name, price, and description with an "Add to Cart" button.                                    |
| FR006          | Add Products to Shopping Cart      | As a user, I want to add products to my cart so I can collect items for potential purchase.                       | The system should allow users to add products to cart from the product details page, with immediate feedback and cart count updates.                                            |
| FR007          | View Shopping Cart Contents        | As a user, I want to view all items in my cart so I can review my selections before checkout.                     | The system should display cart items with thumbnail images, product names, prices, and remove buttons, along with a calculated total amount.                                    |
| FR008          | Remove Items from Cart             | As a user, I want to remove items from my cart so I can modify my selections if I change my mind.                 | The system should provide a remove button for each cart item that instantly removes the item and updates the total calculation.                                                  |
| FR009          | Cart Total Calculation             | As a user, I want to see the total cost of items in my cart so I can understand my potential purchase amount.      | The system should automatically calculate and display the total price of all items in the cart, updating in real-time as items are added or removed.                           |
| FR010          | User Profile Access via URL        | As a user, I want to access user profile information by adding a userId parameter to the URL so I can view user details. | The system should detect userId query parameter (?userId=1) and display a user profile icon in the header when present.                                                        |
| FR011          | User Profile Information Display   | As a user, I want to view comprehensive user details so I can see profile information.                            | The system should show a dedicated user profile page displaying all user information including name, email, phone, and address details from the API.                           |
| FR012          | User Profile Icon in Header        | As a user, I want to see a profile icon in the header when I'm identified so I know the system recognizes me.     | The system should display a user profile icon in the top-right corner of the header only when a valid userId is provided in the URL parameters.                               |
| FR013          | User Parameter Persistence         | As a user, I want my user identity to persist as I navigate through the site so I don't lose my profile context.  | The system should maintain the userId query parameter across all page navigations (product listing, details, cart, profile pages).                                             |
| FR014          | Invalid User Handling              | As a user, if I provide an invalid userId, I want to be notified so I understand why the profile feature isn't working. | The system should validate userId on page load, display error toast messages for invalid/non-existent users, and hide the profile icon gracefully.                            |
| FR015          | Responsive Design Support          | As a user, I want the application to work well on both mobile and desktop devices so I can shop from any device.  | The system should provide responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining usability and visual appeal across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.       |
| FR016          | Error Handling and Notifications   | As a user, I want to be informed when something goes wrong so I can understand system status and take appropriate action. | The system should display toast notifications for API failures, network errors, and user errors, providing clear and actionable error messages.                               |
| FR017          | Product Categories Retrieval       | As a user, I want the category filters to show actual product categories so I can filter by relevant groupings.    | The system should fetch available categories from the API and display them as filter options, ensuring categories match actual product data.                                    |
| FR018          | Checkout Summary Display           | As a user, I want to see a checkout summary of my cart so I can review my order before potentially placing it.     | The system should provide a checkout page showing cart summary without a "Place Order" button, allowing order review for future implementation.                                 |
| FR019          | Empty State Handling               | As a user, I want to see appropriate messages when there are no results so I understand the current state.        | The system should display user-friendly empty state messages for scenarios like empty cart, no search results, or no products in selected categories.                          |
| FR020          | Accessibility Compliance           | As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be accessible so I can use all features effectively.       | The system should meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards including proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader compatibility.                |

### Non-Functional Requirements

|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR001         | Performance Optimization       | As a user, I want the application to load quickly so I can browse products without delays.             | The system should optimize image loading, implement proper caching strategies, and maintain fast page load times across all devices.     |
| NFR002         | API Integration                | As a developer, I want reliable API integration so the application can fetch real product data.         | The system should integrate with FakeStore API endpoints for products, categories, cart operations, and user data with proper error handling. |
| NFR003         | Cross-browser Compatibility    | As a user, I want the application to work in all major browsers so I can use my preferred browser.      | The system should function correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers with consistent behavior and appearance.          |
| NFR004         | Session Management             | As a user, I want my cart to persist during my session so I don't lose items while browsing.           | The system should maintain cart state during the browser session without persistence across browser closures or page refreshes.          |
| NFR005         | Code Quality and Testing       | As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so the application is reliable and maintainable.     | The system should include unit tests for components and utility functions using Jest framework with appropriate test coverage.           |
